AreciboConnector
================

The AreciboConnector traps any errors your application makes and forwards the error information to your
Arecibo account. Once it has done this, it will render a page of your choosing to show the user a friendly notification
that some sort of error has happened.

Example
=======

All you have to do, is tell Arecibo what your account ID is. you do this in your environment files.
Simply set the constant ARECIBO_ACCOUNT to the guid you where given for your Arecibo account.
Something like...

ARECIBO_INFORMATION = {
  :account => 'cd10e6b25c3761600e1559fa40e59928',
  :priority => 1,
  :user_agent => 'Rails Arecibo Connector',
  :url => "http://badapp.org",
  :uid => "123124123123",
  :ip => "127.0.0.1",
  :type => "ὕαλον ϕαγεῖν δύναμαι· τοῦτο οὔ με βλάπτει",
  :server => "Test Script"
}


and then tell your application controller to report to arecibo like so....

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

  send_errors_to_arecibo

Now, by default it will send all errors it finds within controllers and models to the connector, but you can specify a class of error, like so....

  send_errors_to_arecibo ErrorClass
