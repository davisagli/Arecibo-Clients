Arecibo
=======

Contributors: Peter Morris, Andy McKay

This is a plugin to catch errors that occur in your rails sites and forward the errors onto Arecibo.
For more information see Arecibo at http://www.areciboapp.com. Once it has done this you will have to 
pass the user to a nice error page of your choosing.

This library is under the BSD license and is useful example of how Arecibo can be extended to Rails. 
Please change and configure to work with your applications as you see fit, if you'd like to contribute
code back we'd appreciate at.

Installation
============

Install the plugin, by adding the code to vendor/plugins.

Add in the following into you environment, normally this would be config/environment.rb:

ARECIBO_ACCOUNT_NUMBER = 'youraccountnumber'

Where 'youraccountnumber' is replaced with the account number at: http://www.areciboapp.com/setup/keys/

Optional:

Copy assets/arecibo.rhtml to your app/views directory, you can then have this rendered
as a result, so if you copy it to app/views/layouts you can add in the following to get a default template after an error:

ARECIBO_RESULT_TEMPLATE = "layouts/arecibo"

Sending errors
==============

The default setup for Arecibo catches two kinds of errors, 404 and all other errors. A 404 is passed as priority 5
and everything else priority 1. These should me altered to suit your needs (see configuration below)

In both cases Rails catches the error and forwards it on Arecibo and then renders an error back to the user.
If the sending to Arecibo fails, then a log message is written containing the error.

Pre Rails 2.0
=============

Add the following into your application contoller (controllers/application.rb):

  def rescue_action(exception)
    report_to_arecibo(exception)
  end

Rails 2.0 and beyond
==========================

There is a rescue_from method that can be used. Add the following into your application controller:

  send_errors_to_arecibo
  
Configuration and options
=========================

The ARECIBO_RESULT_TEMPLATE variable can be set to any value you'd like to render an error back. You'll get
a @arecibodata available to you which allows you to show any information you'd like to, by default we only
show the UID for looking up in Arecibo.

You can pass an error to Arecibo at any time anywhere else by doing:

  send_errors_to_arecibo ErrorClass

And finally there's a method in arecibo/lib/wrapper.rb called: override_arecibo where you can put any overrides
or changes to the data you'd like to send, improving the information for you.
